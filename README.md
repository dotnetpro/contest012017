# OpenQuoridorFramework (OQF)
[date of snapshot: 22th October 2016]

OpenQuoridorFramework is a set of libraries and applications to create bots for Quoridor, play against them and do a lot more cool stuff around Quoridor.

This subset of OQF comes with two applications:
1. PlayerVsBot:  An application to play (as human) against an OQF-Bot
2. ReplayViewer: An application to analize (review) a past game

---

To write a OQF-Bot you have to implement the IQuoridorBot-Inteface which can be found at OQF.Bot.Contracts. You can get more detailed information from the help-pages of PlayerVsBot.
